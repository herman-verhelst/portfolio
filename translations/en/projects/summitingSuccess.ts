            description: 'The Tour de France, a powerful cycling race, has captured the imagination of fans worldwide for over a century. For more than a hundred years, the best riders have pushed themselves to their limits for eternal glory. For more than a hundred years, there has always been someone who is the very best. But can comparisons really be made between all these editions and riders? This question intrigued me as a cycling enthusiast, so I started digging into data and records: stage winners, number of days in the leader\'s jersey, or the margin by which the lead rider outpaced the runner-up. Using D3.js, I developed this data visualization. It enables cycling fans to compare editions and winners. Colors, shapes, and numbers, each element tells its own story, bringing more clarity to this epic race.'
