        description: 'Designing a clear, scientifically accurate, and aesthetically refined animation of a complex mechanical movement is no small feat. I was tasked with creating three related animations themed around “movement in (or through) water.” My approach focused on minimalist forms, using animations with deceptively simple movements and clean color gradients to provide viewers with an understanding of how a lock, a hydroelectric power plant, or a dam operates. Together, these three animations form a cohesive whole, explaining concepts on an interactive map. The consistent visual style not only ties the themes together but also enhances the animations’ aesthetic appeal.'
