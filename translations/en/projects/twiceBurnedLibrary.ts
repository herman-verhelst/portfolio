            'Even in the digital world, a beautifully crafted book retains its unique value. I naturally place great importance on thoughtful design and a well-chosen typeface, but I also enjoy experimenting with the surprising and challenging interplay between text and image on the one hand, and between printed space and white space on the other. The content, target audience, and ease of use all help shape the final result.\n' +
            'As with my other projects, in the design and execution, I combine modern digital applications with traditional craftsmanship. In my “lettered projects,” this craftsmanship is especially evident in unique, hand-bound copies in linen of a special edition.'
