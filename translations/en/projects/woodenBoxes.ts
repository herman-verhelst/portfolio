        description: 'Each box in this collection of twenty holds a unique color palette, borrowed from the street scenes that sparked my curiosity as an observant passerby. These scenes—filled with a multitude of unique color combinations—first took form in an ordinary photo of an old bicycle against a wall, a doorbell, or peeling paint on a rain barrel. From these photos with their one-of-a-kind color combinations, purely accidental, I sought the ideal proportions of each color, using a self-designed computer program to calculate the size of each color area in percentage. The size of each color area determined the dimensions of the wooden blocks hidden under the lid of an unassuming wooden box, as seemingly ordinary as the street photos themselves. Only descriptive color names hint at what lies within. When you open the box, you’re invited into a new world of color, with three, four, five, or even more wooden blocks painted with acrylic. At the very bottom, deeply hidden, you’ll find the original photo that inspired the contents of each box. Will you join me in the challenge of finding color in the seeming mundanity of an ordinary street scene?'
