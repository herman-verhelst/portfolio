        description: 'Tall — quite literally tall — people sometimes feel burdened by their height, experiencing it as a disadvantage. A survey and study conducted by a university student confirmed this feeling (one I also experience) with data. But numbers alone don’t always capture the imagination, so I brought this data to life in five illustrations inspired by daily life: the search for long-enough pants, the struggle for legroom on public transport, beds that are too short… Tall people — like myself — know these challenges well. I hand-printed these illustrations on t-shirts worn by tall individuals, hoping to inspire a bit more understanding. I also designed a wooden coat rack… sized specifically for tall people.'
