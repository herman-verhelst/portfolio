Initiated as a project in the Special Computing Lab at LUCA {'|'} School of Arts to explore these questionsâ€¦ now transformed into an interactive feature on this website. The projects displayed here were created in TouchDesigner and Processing in the Special Computing Lab. Discover how the world appears in low resolution by activating your camera. Move slowly or quickly, change colors, and create your own image of yourself or others. A fascinating exploration awaits."
