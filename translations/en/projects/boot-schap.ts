        description: 'My pursuit of refined forms goes beyond the boundaries of the digital world. In my free time, I work with wood, creating new shapes from leftover materials and experimenting with whatever crosses my path. An old lathe, a simple band saw, a sander, and a few chisels challenge me time and again to reveal the hidden form of a boat or another vessel. Each boat embodies a message of sustainability and beauty, resulting in a unique, handmade piece where the imperfections of the wood often play a starring role.',
